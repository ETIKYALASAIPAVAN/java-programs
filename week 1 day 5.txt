1.write an algorithm whether a number is a perfect number or not

1.start
2. read the positive integer as n
3. initialize sum=0, i=1
4. reapeat and execute the steps a,b until(i<n)
 
a. if(n%i==0)
{
  sum = sum + i
}
 
b. i=i+1

5. if (sum==n)
 
print "n is a perfect number"

else 

print "n is not a perfect number

6. stop 

2.write a algorithm to find wheather an year is a leap year or not

1.start
2.read the year
